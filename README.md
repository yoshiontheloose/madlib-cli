# File IO and Exceptions

**Author**: Clarissa
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
In this lab assignment you will be creating a command line application which takes advantage of Pythonâ€™s built in capabilities for reading and writing files.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Create Poetry environment/setup repo

### Feature Tasks and Requirements

- Create a file called madlib.py at root of madlib_cli folder, which will contain all of the Python code that you will write relating to your Madlib game.

- Keeping in mind the concept of Single Responsibility Principle, build a command line tool which will perform the following:

- Print a welcome message to the user, explaining the Madlib process and command line interactions

- Read a template Madlib file (Example), and parse that file into usable parts.
- Prompt the user to submit a series of words to fit each of the required components of the Madlib template.

- With the collected user inputs, populate the template such that each provided input is placed into the correct position within the template.

- After the resulting Madlib has been completed, provide the completed response back to the user in the command line.

- Write the completed text (Example)to a new file on your file system (in the repo).

- Note: A smaller example file is included as well which can be handy when developing/testing.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

Python, Poetry

## Change Log

<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Estimates
<!-- See below -->

## Credit and Collaborations
<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->
